  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      OPAM uses ~/.opam by default for its package database, so you need to
      initialize it first by running:

      $ opam init
    EOS
  end

  test do
    system bin/"opam", "init", "--auto-setup", "--compiler=ocaml-system", "--disable-sandboxing"
    system bin/"opam", "list"
  end
end
